In this directory, I am saving my code that I experimented with that is strongly intact or less customized from specific books and tutorials. Of course the goal of going through texts and examples is to implement them in the applications for this repository, but the files here are code that relies on the sources more heavily and is not an attempt at implementation.

I will try to be good about putting the source reference on each code example/file, but I will at least maintain here a complete list of the source material I use to teach myself web graphics programming for this application.
